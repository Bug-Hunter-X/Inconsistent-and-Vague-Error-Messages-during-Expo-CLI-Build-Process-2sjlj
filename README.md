# Inconsistent and Vague Error Messages during Expo CLI Build Process

This repository demonstrates a bug in the Expo CLI where build processes fail with unhelpful error messages.  The error is inconsistent, appearing in different situations. Debugging is challenging due to the lack of specific error details in the logs. This example showcases a reproducible scenario and a potential solution.

## Steps to Reproduce

1. Clone this repository.
2. Install dependencies using `npm install` or `yarn install`.
3. Attempt to run `expo build:ios` or `expo build:android`.  The build will likely fail with an unclear error message.

## Potential Solutions

The provided solution involves more verbose logging and careful checks within the Expo project's configuration and build scripts.  Improving error handling in the Expo CLI itself would be the ideal solution, providing detailed error messages to aid in debugging.
